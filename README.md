# Project 1: Pendulum
## Description
This project is about simulating a Pendulum using the Euler and Leap-Frog methods.
### Parameters
- Mass M = 0.5kg
- Length L = 1m
- Acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8m/s^2
- Initial angles measured with respect to the vertical alpha = 
  - pi/8
  - pi/4
  - 3pi/8
  - pi/2
- Requires at least six (6) significant digits for computations

### Programs
There are 3 programs in total:
Calculating the period via a series expansion for given series
Write a program for Euler's method
Write a program for the Leap-Frog method

## TODO
Note that this only includes programming
- [ ] Calculate Period
- [ ] Euler's Method
- [ ] Leap-Frog Method
